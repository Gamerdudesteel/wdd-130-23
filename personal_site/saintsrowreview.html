          <h1>Saint's Row(2006)</h1>
          <h3>Fun, but frustrating</h3>
          <p class="Paragraph-1">
            Saint's row one is one of those games that was well recieved at the
            time at came out but did NOT age well. This game which came out
            waaay back in 2006. I was only 10 at the time and had never played
            or even heard of it at the time but decades later, when the half
            baked reboot flopped in 2022 I kept hearing about how good saints
            row 2 is. I'm not the kind of person who playes games out of order
            so I decided to play the entire series and i'm glad I did.
          </p>
          <p class="Paragraph-1">
            Saint's row came out at a time when it had no compitition. It was
            obviosly "inspired" by the grand theft auto series but the last
            console gta came out 2 years prior and the handheld gta liberty city
            stories simply didn't satisfy gamers need for urban carnage. Enter
            saints row. Despite this games 80 something percent metacritic
            score, this game pissed me off. and yet, I couldn't stop playing.
            The weapons have no precision aiming (except for the sniper rifle)
            so you have to "hip fire" them. in order to progress the story you
            need to complete missions (I shouldn't have to explain what these
            are) and in order to UNLOCK the missions you need to fill a
            "respect" bar (this bar has no other purpose). This bar is filled by
            completing multiple "activities" and to be quite honest these
            activities are quite humerous and entertaining. at first. Activites
            range from "insurance fraud" where you repeatedly throw yourself
            into traffic to mayhem where the goal is to cause as much
            destruction as possible. However with each level of these activities
            the difficulty increses and the room for errer decreases. these
            activites go from amusing diversion to frustrating chore in
            relatively little time .Little room for error is the theme of this
            entire game. The missions themselves are enjoyable enough. There are
            three "branches" which can be started and finished in any order (as
            long as you have enough respect and have completed the previous
            mission) these missions have no checkpoints, if you die or fail for
            any other reason then you have to start the entire thing over.
            sometimes failing a mission isn't even your fault. there had been
            more than a few occasions where I drove into a pit too small for my
            car but too big to get out of and i HAD to use THAT car, or when
            someone else was driving and i'm shooting and the ai gets stuck on a
            log and gives up (you cant exit the car and finish the mission
            yourself) and the only option is to restart. I guess that's all the
            negatives.I mean i DID play through the entire thing so something
            must be worth it. The game itself has a rich charecter editor, a
            large fleet of vehicles, a bustling city FILLED with things to do, a
            decent sense of humor, a large arsenal, you can dress your charecter
            as santa(amongst other lesser outfits) and i did, the story is
            engaging and satisfying to complete and the graphics arent terrible
            for 2006. overall i give this game a 6 out of 10 (for its age)
          </p>

          <h1>Saint's row 2</h1>
          <h3>The best of the bunch (by far)and the perfect sequel</h3>
          <p class="Paragraph-1">
            saint's row 2 came out in 2008, the same year as it's direct
            competitor gta 4 (and my favorite pc game, spore) I've played both
            gta 4 and sr2 and only finished saints row, so what does that tell
            you? I'm not going to lie here, there had been times playing saints
            row 1 where i felt overwhelmed and considered using cheats or even
            skipping the game and just watching the cutscnes online (I didn't
            and i'm glad) I never once felt that way playing saint's row 2. sr2
            added all the features sr1 needed like precision aiming and mission
            checkpoints and also added features I did't even know I needed like
            the ability to weild various objects as temporary weapons. and drive
            new vehicles such as boats, motorcycles, helicopters, and planes.
            You still need respect to play missions but it doesnt feel like as
            much of a chore this time around because you can earn respect DURING
            missions and other ways as well. It's rewarded through kills and
            stunts and the activities are more fun and forgiving. You can also
            use "style points" to increase the amount of respect you can earn by
            eprgading various "cribs" around the map and buying clothes. my
            personal favoite is one where you pretend to be a cop for a
            "reality" tv show and commit various acts of police brutality
            "flamethowers are standard issue right?" saint's row 2 also allows
            you to choose a voice for your charecter. unlike in saints row 1
            where your charecters voice was tied to his race (and only had 5
            lines each) saints row 2 allows you to choose from 3 male and 3
            female voices. I really can't think of anything wrong with this
            game. It had a great story and it was fun. Really what else is there
            to say? 10/10
          </p>

          <h1>Saint's row the third</h1>
          <h3>The series takes a left turn into a goofy tone</h3>
          <p>
            This game takes 3 steps forward and 2 steps back. They decided to
            drop the whole "gangster" attitude of the charerects so now they're
            gangsters who arent, you know.. gangster. This game is more linear.
            You have to complete all the main missions in order so you don't get
            to decide what gang goes down first. the healing item menu slots
            have been replaced with grenade slots, I honestly prefer being able
            to heal mid battle than use a grenade. The missions don't need
            respect to play anymore so you can just plow right through the game
            if you want. and I did. on the plus side, there is now a level up
            system to upgrade your charecter with things like faster healing and
            running which makes respect actually useful. you can also upgrade
            your weapons too. The art style for this game is completly
            different, the charecters are more muscular. I played the remastered
            version which crashed about 6 times turing my 13 hour playthrough.
            overall I think this game took a turn for the worse and as much as i
            enjoyed it. it wasn't saints row 2. 7/10
          </p>

          <h1>Saint's row 4</h1>
          <h3>superman meets the matrix meets any alien movie</h3>
          <p>
            My biggest complaint about saints row 4 is that it reuses the same
            map as saints row 3. But at the same time it doesnt really matter
            that much because most of the missions take place outside of the
            world map. My second complaint is that the super speed that your
            charecter unlocks quite early in the game makes every vehicle
            obsolete. my third complaint about this games is the tone and
            atmosphere. If you thought saints row the third was all over the
            place then saints row 4 throws any noralicy straight out of the
            window. the grenade slot has been replaced yet again with a power
            slot. The 4 powers in these slots, blast, stomp, buff, and
            telekenisis are very powerful and interesting but take way too long
            to recharge to be "super" usefull so unlike cars you will still need
            to keep your weapons around, full, and upgraded because your combat
            powers don't cut it by themselves. The story in this game is it's
            worst element. It completely ignores the gangster element of the
            first three games and replaces it with this bizzare superhero matrix
            thing where you have to stop aliens. After playing through it to the
            end i'd have to say that the strongest part of this game are the
            missions. They're admitidly more enjoyable than the ones in it's
            predicesor but that alone doesnt save this game. 6/10

          <h1>Saint's row: Gat out of hell</h1>
          <h3>Ambitious Dlc turned standlone game</h3>
          <p>
            Gat out of hell takes place an indeterminate amount of time after
            saints row 4. The player charecter from the previous 4 games (Or
            previous 2 games if you subscribe to the theory the main charecter
            was somehow replaced between 2 and 3) Is sucked into hell and Johnny
            Gat (and kinzie but be real, this games about johnny) Must go rescue
            them. That's all about the story i'm gonna touch. We went from a
            modern gangster story to dante's inferno (if that's nnot at least
            similar to the plot of dante's inferno thats cause i never read the
            book, all i know is the main charecter goes to hell. (or at least
            thats what i gather)) Gat out of hell is enjoyable with it's new
            flight mechanic (yes the superhero themed saints row 4 was
            completely lacking flight from its roster of powers.) And it's new
            setting of "new hades" the "capital of hell" is interesting with
            several distrects. Now for the critisism. The whole game is only 4
            an a half hours long. For a 15 dollar game that's not fantastic but
            i've heard worse. Secondly, this game has ZERO customization. It's
            expected not to have a charecter creator since you play as Fan
            favorite musclehead gun nut Johnny gat and thats fine, but there are
            no clothing stores, custom car garages, or weapon skins. You do not
            get to make this game your own in any way. Problem number three and
            by far the biggest one is there are only 3 traditional missions, the
            rest of the missions involve completing simmilar tasks and
            activities from previous games. Problem number 4 (im gonna combine 2
            cause they go hand in hand) Is the vehivle variety and lack of
            music. There are only like 4 different cars in the game and there
            are no radio stations or music of any kind. previous saint's row
            games had excelent soundtracks. This one had no soundtrack.This game
            isn't all negative, the weapons are fun, the powers are useful. The
            dialog is enntertaining, its fun, don't get me wrong. It's just not
            enough to justify spending 15 dollars on. 5/10
