      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this website is to provide ratings and reviews
       of games, movies and tv shows from a conservative point of view.
        My idea for this website came about when wired published their obviously bias review of 
        hogwarts legacy and rated it a 1/10 despite the game recieving near universal acclaim.
        this low score was obviosly motivated by Jk rowlings view that men and women are different 
        and not about the game itself. This kind of "journalism" is not only tolerated but featured on
        the google review scores. My goal is to combat these types of dishonest and politically motivated reviews
        which are not only in gaming but in moves, for instance if you look at rotten tomatoes you will see the
        obvious devide in opinion between "critics" and moviegoers, for instance "star wars: the last jedi" was 
        rated 91% by "critics" and 42% by people who werent bribed into writing good reviews by disney.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is anyone who is tired of mainstream media rags and wants news, rumors, leaks, and reviews
        from a different, objectively better perspective.</p>  <!-- change this -->

	Why will people come to my site? People will (hopefully) come to my site because they want honest rerviews that are unjaded by money, politics, or hype. There wil also be a gaming forum for people to discuss gaming related topics, such as opinions and rumors about games. Another reason people will come to my site is that it will be unique in presentation and writing style, it won't be in a generic “journalist” style of writing nor will the articles or reviews be written from a huped fanboy perspective. For intance “the legend of zelda: breath of the wild” got 5/5 by metacritic and 10/10 from ign. I can list several reasons that's not an accurate rating off the top of my head. For intance every dungeon looks the same and there are only 4 of them, the game has a terrible “ambient” soundtrack with very few actual songs,weapons break way too easily and cannot be repired, leaving link defenseless as he cannot attack without them. The casting choices were terrible and so cringewrothy. Why does zelda have a british accent when nobody else, not even her own father does? The map may be big but it feels empty and the chore like shrines and endless korok seeds do not flll the void, speaking of the seeds; there are 900 of them in game and you only need 441 to max out your invetory making 459 of them absolutely useless. Enough about zelda, I was demonstrating how I can be fair and critical of things that are universally loved and I'm sure people can appreciate that.

	What questions will my visitors expect my site to answer for them? My site will answer the following questions: Should I buy this game/watch this movie/show? (answer varies) do you have the lastest information about games? Probobly unless its been over-covered. Do you cover gaming leaks? Yes! Do you post leaked artwork or footage? It depends on if the company is known for filing copyright strikes/dmca takedowns. Is there a forum? Yes. Is the forum heavily moderated? No just don't post porn, gore, threats or doxxings. How often is the site updated? Whenever I feel the need to/ feel like it.

	What type of activities will visitors want to complete on my site? Well I would also offer flash games but ever since flash player shut down (worst tragedy of the decade) browser based games havent really been any good.  Besides reading articles and writing in the forum and comment section, visitors will also ocasionally vote in polls.

	What information is necessary to complete any actions my site offers? You need an account to write comments or post on the forum. Otherwise, that's it. This is actually a pretty standard answer for this type of question and to be honest i'm not sure I fully understad what it is that you're asking.

	Why will visitors come to my site instead of another to get this information? As I said earlier, this website will offer free speech and an unbiased perspective of games and other media. People will also appreciate the forum and links to animated videos and songs and other things that I find interesting. I hope this will be a place where simmilar minded people find common grounds and become friends.
