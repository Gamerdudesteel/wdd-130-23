          <h1>The suicide squad game is going to SUCK</h1>
          <h3>EIGHT years for THIS?</h3>
          <p>
            Rocksteady made masterpieces. When rocksteady was approached by
            warner bros to make a batman game, they only had ONE game under
            their belt; Urban chaos: riot response, a 2006 first person shooter.
            Warner bros liked the game SO much that they trusted rocksteady with
            their most valuable i.p batman. Unlike urban chaos, the batman
            series were third person games where you don't use guns. These games
            were perfect. Yes perfect. They were nothing short of masterpieces.
            I can't tell you how good they are so go play them yourself (I
            finished every game in the series twice and city 3 times). The
            arkhman games were released from 2009 to 2015, thats 7 years. in
            2020, 5 years later, suicide squad: Kill the justice leauge was
            announced. the next year it was announced for a 2022 release, the
            next year it was delayed to 2023, a total of 8 years since arkham
            knight. now there's rumors of a SECOND delay. Why could that be?
            because the game sucks and they know it. When the first full 15
            minuets gameplay trailer was released it was FLOODED with dislikes
            and negative comments. most of these comments repeat the same
            complaints: All the charecters play the same, why does a shark use a
            gun? why does harley quin have such an annoying voice? was arleen
            sorkin not good enough? how does anyone stand doing prolonged
            recording sessions with tara strong? The gameplay consists of
            shooting purple blobs, why do all the charecters fly? how dare you
            put microtransations in a 70 dollar game? why does captain boomerang
            use a gun instead of a boomerang? why does it need to be online for
            singleplayer? The most important question is how could you take
            EIGHT YEARS to make THIS? it's infuriating to fans. as of the time
            i'm writing this the trailer on the official playstation channel has
            9 thousand likes and 51 thousand dislikes. This is why youtube
            disabled visible dislikes, not for "small creators". The intense
            hatred for cheap soulless live service cash grab GARBAGE is clear!
            so what can a game company do? delay it! again! not to fix the baked
            in issues that plauge the game (shoot purple blobs, numbers go up,
            charecters are the same)no, it's too late for that, all they can do
            now is move the game to a less crowded release window so they don't
            have to compete with the legend of zelda. Honestly the choice is
            either make a little bit of money or make no money and if they stick
            with the current release date it will be the latter. It's obvious
            that rocksteady didn't want to make this game, after all BOTH of the
            companies founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker left the company
            near the end of 2022. They had previously worked for argnaut games
            which closed in 2004 (fun fact; argounats last game was based on the
            catwoman movie, meaning arkham city wasn't jamie and Seftons first
            experience with the charecter) Jamie and Sefton did't leave the
            company for nothing. But they wouldn't exatly say why either. It's
            my personal belief that with their contractual obligations complete
            on suicide squad, they chose to take what was left of their dignity
            elsewhere. I guarentee that this live service bs was thought up not
            by rocksteady but by out of touch warner brothers exectutives and
            their greedy shareholders. This game will suck and fail and
            rocksteady will fall as a result. How hard is yet to be seen.
